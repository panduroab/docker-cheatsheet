#Docker Cheatsheet

##What is Docker?
"Docker is a command-line program, a background daemon, and a set of remote services that take a logistical approach to solve common software problems and simplify your experience installing, running, publishing, and removing software. It accomplishes this using a Unix technology called containers". -Jeff Nickoloff. Docker in Action.

The main goal of containers is isolate processes from all protected resources. Docker will help us to build and administer those containers easily.

##Containers != Virtualization
Virtual machines provide virtual hardware and a whole copy of an operating system. It takes significant system resources.

Docker containers don't use virtual hardware instead, contenerized programs runs directly with the host's Linux kernel.

Docker is not a virtualization technology. It helps you use Linux Containers.
